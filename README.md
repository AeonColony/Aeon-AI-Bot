# Aeon-AI-Bot
This is the main AI bot code for the Telegram group chat with instructions on how to create your own module for the bot.
The bot was originally written in python, but the modules have been converted into PHP to work seamlessly within the API.

# Creating a new module.
Creating a new module is easy, just use the attached template to see what is available for use.
Make sure that your command for the module is different from others or else the bot will not be able to differentiate between the commands.

# To add your newly created module to the bot
Please create a new fork and then add your newly created module into the modules folder and create a pull request to merge your newly created module to the repo - Once merged and verified it can take upto 48 hours for the bot to successfully register and start working with your command.
