# Aeon-AI-Bot
This is the main AI bot code for the Telegram group chat with instructions on how to create your own module for the bot.
The bot was originally written in python, but the modules have been converted into PHP to work seamlessly within the API.

Creating a new module is easy, just use the attached template to create an push a module.
Make sure that your command for the module is different from others or else the bot will not be able to differentiate between the commands.
